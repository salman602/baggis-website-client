                <h4 className="text-danger text-start my-2">OUR STORY</h4>
                <p className="text-start">From European mainland, Berliner Bags story dates back to the year 2014 when its founder Kees completed his Business studies at the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands. While still a student, Kees noticed a gap in the market and realized how difficult it was to find a durable yet affordable & fashionable vintage bag for work and leisure. This motivated Kees and gave him an idea to launch a fashion startup specializing in leather bags.With a strong affinity for design and creativity, Kees deepened his skills attending design courses in Italy and learning about various designs from ex-Gucci employees. He nurtured Berliner bags from just an idea into a fully-fledged concept that has continued to blossom under his stewardship. He serves as the chief design officer for the brand.Innovative, shrewd, and progressive, Berliner Bags presented the companyâ€™s first modern black leather collection in the early months of 2019. We aim to craft pieces that are modern yet timeless. And thanks to the artisanal nature of our processes and the full-grain and vegetable-tanned leather we exclusively use, Berliner Bags merchandise will certainly stand the test of time.</p>
